# data_Analysis_SM_2025

This repository contains scripts and data for analyzing temperature and humidity measurements collected by the St. Matthias sensors in 2025.

The main Streamlit application is `streamlit_app.py`. It loads measurement exports from the `data/` directory and provides interactive visualizations and summary statistics.

Run the application with:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
